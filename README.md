# ParentChildProcessExample
An example project for demonstrating the use of Parent and Child Processes.

These files were completed during Assignment 3 of Operating Systems. This is an example as to how to use parent-child processes within linux using c++. Each file uses different applications for connecting together the final data input (program1V2 uses pipes, program2 uses dup2()).

The goal of this was to learn how to use child and parent processes.


## Installation
- Project requires being run within linux (I used ubuntu).
